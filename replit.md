# AION - Sistema de IA Autônomo

## Overview
AION is an enterprise-grade autonomous AI system designed for robustness, flexibility, and self-operation, extending beyond current LLM limitations. Its purpose is to deliver a self-sustaining, continuously evolving AI that learns and improves autonomously, reducing reliance on external APIs over time. Key capabilities include configurable policy enforcement, RAG-based knowledge retrieval, advanced autonomous agents using POMDP with a ReAct framework, and professional video generation. The system provides a chat interface for end-users and an administrative dashboard with a 7-Trait Personality Equalizer. It incorporates production-ready autonomous meta-learning capabilities, including a Meta-Learner Service, an Adaptive Mixture of Experts (ShiftEx MoE), a Personalized expert selection (PM-MoE Aggregator), and a Self-Improvement Engine for autonomous code analysis and patching.

## System Architecture

### Core System Design
AION operates in a single-tenant mode with a multi-agent architecture and LLM-driven Mixture of Experts (MoE) routing, implementing a **GPU-FIRST 4-level priority chain** with automatic fallback and universal multi-language support (PT-BR, EN-US, ES-ES). It supports specialized agents with dedicated knowledge base namespaces, tool access, and budget limits. A Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) knowledge curation system requires human approval for all content before indexing.

**GPU-FIRST INFERENCE ARCHITECTURE (Updated 2025):**
The system implements a revolutionary **GPU-FIRST** priority order that maximizes zero-cost GPU inference before falling back to external APIs:

1. **KB + GPU Integration (Primary):** Knowledge Base search (confidence ≥ 0.7) triggers immediate GPU activation via DemandBasedKaggleOrchestrator for inference, with explicit auto-shutdown after completion (zero API cost, tracked via provider='gpu-internal').
2. **Web Search + GPU Integration (Secondary):** If KB fails or has low confidence, DuckDuckGo web search provides content that is then processed by GPU inference with immediate shutdown (zero API cost for processing).
3. **Free APIs Fallback (Tertiary):** If GPU fails, auto-fallback to free API rotation: Groq → Gemini → HuggingFace → OpenRouter.
4. **OpenAI Fallback (Last Resort):** GPT-4o only activated when all free resources exhausted (paid API).

**GPU Orchestration Features:**
- Demand-Based Kaggle Orchestrator with on-demand start/stop (28h/week quota management)
- Explicit auto-shutdown immediately after each inference job completes (via orchestrator.stopSession() in finally block)
- Safeguarded zero-cost tracking via trackTokenUsage (provider='gpu-internal', cost=0, wrapped in try/catch to prevent tracking errors from aborting valid GPU responses)
- GPU Pool System with worker detection, heartbeat monitoring, load balancing, and inference priority

A Continuous Self-Evolution System collects high-quality conversations for instruction tuning and dataset generation, applying HITL. Full Multimodal Processing supports various document types, images, videos, YouTube transcripts, and Deep Web Crawling with **dual-mode URL learning** (single-page scan vs deep crawl with optional media download). The Vision Cascade System provides automatic failover across 5 providers with quota tracking. The agent system includes a level-based hierarchy for agents and sub-agents with cascading deletion. Federated Learning is fully implemented. User & RBAC Management provides enterprise-level user and permission management. The system incorporates a Meta-Learner Service, Adaptive Mixture of Experts (ShiftEx MoE), a Personalized Expert Selection (PM-MoE Aggregator), and a Self-Improvement Engine for autonomous code analysis. Namespace isolation with schema updates ensures cross-tenant protection. Privacy-preserving heuristics are implemented via adaptive thresholds, LoRA fine-tuning, PII redaction, and a replay buffer.

### UI/UX
The frontend is built with React 18, Vite, Wouter, and TanStack Query, utilizing Radix UI, shadcn/ui patterns, Tailwind CSS, and a custom HSL-based design system. It features an elegant minimalist design with modern glassmorphism, offering a clean conversational chat interface and an enterprise-level Admin Panel with a consolidated hierarchical menu and full Internationalization (i18n) supporting PT-BR (default), EN-US, ES-ES. All administrative pages are translated, including Dataset, Agent, and Curation Queue management. The Curation Queue for HITL review supports filtering and batch actions. Vision System monitoring displays real-time quota tracking. AI-powered semantic image search and Health Diagnostics are included. The Personality Equalizer offers granular control via 7 functional sliders.

**GPU Management Dashboard (Unified Architecture - Nov 2024):**
The GPU Management interface has been consolidated into a single unified page (`GPUOverviewPage.tsx`) that aggregates both manual and auto-managed GPU workers with RBAC security. Key features include:
- Single `/api/gpu/overview` endpoint protected with `requirePermission("gpu:view")` that returns all workers (manual + auto-managed), global stats, and orchestrator status
- Stats cards displaying: Total Workers, Online Workers, Total Requests, Average Latency
- Unified worker table with visual badges: "Auto" workers (purple badge with Zap icon) for auto-managed Kaggle/Colab notebooks, "Manual" workers (gray badge with Cpu icon) for manually added GPUs
- Quota status display exclusively for auto-managed workers (Kaggle 28h/week tracking)
- Orchestration controls (Start/Stop) protected with `requirePermission("gpu:orchestrate")`
- All GPU endpoints secured with RBAC: `gpu:view` for read operations, `gpu:manage` for CRUD operations, `gpu:orchestrate` for start/stop controls
- Real-time status monitoring with 30-second auto-refresh

### Technical Implementations
The backend uses Node.js and TypeScript with Express.js and PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM. Key services include LLM Client, Storage, Multi-Agent Router (MoE), namespace-scoped RAG, Agent Engine (ReAct with POMDP), Automatic Fallback, Production-Grade Multimodal Processing, Web Content Discovery, YouTube Transcription Service, Vision Cascade, free LLM Provider rotation, GPU Orchestrator, GPU Pool Manager, GPU Load Balancer, Training Data Collector, Dataset Generator, Auto-Learning System, Token Monitoring, Lifecycle Management, Orphan Detection, Validation (Zod schemas), and a Comprehensive Telemetry System. The Kaggle CLI Service uses environment variables for authentication, lazy loading from SecretsVault, UPM integration, multi-account support, and production-grade error handling. The system includes a Colab Orchestrator Service for Puppeteer automation, a GPU Management UI, a GPU Deletion Service, and an Auto-Scaling Service with a 24/7 Orchestrator. The Namespace Classifier uses LLM-based auto-classification. A Persistent Vector Store is PostgreSQL-backed with LRU cache. Robust error handling and structured logging are implemented. The frontend implements a centralized i18n system and uses Replit Auth (OpenID Connect). RAG combines OpenAI embeddings with BM25. Professional video generation uses an asynchronous job queue. Multi-Cloud Deployment uses Google Cloud Run and AWS Fargate. Training data validation and a Lifecycle Management System are in place. The system implements a production-grade multi-provider billing architecture with real-time cost tracking and automated synchronization. Tool registration uses a mapping layer to bridge database tool names to agentTools registry keys. Message and tool execution persistence is bulletproof, ensuring data integrity. Enterprise Backup & Recovery System provides full database exports with admin-only access, rate limiting (1 backup/hour), temporary file streaming (no permanent storage), automatic cleanup of temp files >1hr old, atomic restore operations with safety snapshots, file validation (schema + size limits), and comprehensive audit logging via structured pino logging with userId, IP, requestId, and operationId tracking.

### System Design Decisions
Key decisions include single-tenant architecture and externalized JSON behavioral configurations for dynamic updates. Comprehensive observability and telemetry include query monitoring, granular hierarchical usage analytics, a modern dashboard with Recharts visualizations, PostgreSQL trigram indexes for optimized search performance, and 29 production-ready REST endpoints for metric access. Security involves AES-256-GCM encryption for API credentials stored in a SecretsVault and injected as environment variables at runtime, supporting multi-account management with individual quota tracking.
