- **✅ SD-XL GPU Worker Template** (`kb_storage/gpu_workers/sd_xl/`):
  - FastAPI server with text2img and img2img endpoints
  - Auto-registers with GPU Pool via heartbeat system
  - Dockerfile optimized for Kaggle/Modal deployment
  - Production-grade error handling, logging, structured responses
  - Health check endpoint for monitoring
  - Deployment scripts: `deploy_kaggle.py` (Kaggle Notebooks API), `deploy_modal.py` (Modal serverless)

- **✅ ImageGenerationCascade GPU-First Integration**:
  - Priority chain: SD-XL GPU Workers → Pollinations → DALL-E
  - Auto-discovery via GPU Pool heartbeat system
  - Quota tracking for all providers (hourly reset)
  - Production-grade fallback handling
  - Comprehensive telemetry and structured logging
  - 100% free GPU workers (zero cost for high-confidence KB matches)

- **✅ KB Similarity-Based img2img Tool** (`transform-image`):
  - CRITICAL PRODUCTION REQUIREMENT: GPU usage ONLY when KB similarity >= 0.7
  - Three execution paths:
    * High-confidence KB match (>= 0.7): Uses GPU workers (free, local)
    * Low-confidence KB match (< 0.7): Skips GPU, uses Pollinations/DALL-E
    * Direct image upload: Skips GPU (no confidence metric), uses Pollinations/DALL-E
  - Semantic KB search with cosine similarity scoring
  - Returns best available match (no random selection)
  - `useGPU` flag propagates through entire cascade (no bypass paths)
  - Comprehensive logging for compliance verification and audit trails

- **✅ Tool Registration**: TransformImage registered in agentTools registry with proper Zod schema, agent permission system, and KB integration

- **✅ GPU Gating Architecture** (Multiple Architect Iterations):
  - findKBImage() returns best match + similarity score (no threshold rejection)
  - transformImage() sets useGPU flag based on confidence threshold
  - generateImageFromImage() respects useGPU at all branches (early return + fallback)
  - generateImage() skips GPU discovery entirely when useGPU=false
  - Production compliance: GPU workers NEVER invoked for low-confidence or direct uploads
  - Design validated through 5+ architect review cycles to eliminate all bypass paths

**Architect Review**: All tasks reviewed and approved for production deployment. GPU gating strictly enforces confidence >= 0.7 requirement with no bypass paths. System ready for QA validation.

### 2025-11-09 - ReAct Engine Integration Complete ✅
**Tasks #27-31 Production-Ready & Architect Approved**

- **✅ Tool Name Mapping Layer**: Implemented production-ready TOOL_NAME_MAP in runtime.ts to bridge DB tool names ("Knowledge Base Search", "Web Search") to agentTools registry keys ("KBSearch", "SearchWeb", "GenerateImage"). Fully documented with maintenance guidelines for future tool additions.

- **✅ End-to-End Validation**: Successfully tested image generation via ReAct engine:
  - 3 tool_executions persisted in PostgreSQL (2 failures + 1 success with intelligent auto-retry)
  - Image generated and saved to kb_storage/generated_images/ (permanent storage)
  - ReAct completed in 4 steps with 1 attachment
  - Assistant message updated correctly with proper FK constraints
  - HITL curation flow triggered automatically for quality control

- **✅ Persistence Architecture**: Bulletproof message/tool execution persistence:
  - routes.ts creates assistant message BEFORE orchestration (prevents FK violations)
  - Updates content AFTER completion (ensures data integrity)
  - Deletes empty messages on failure (no orphaned records)

- **✅ Initialization Order Fix**: Resolved seed/loader race condition by moving seedDatabase() call to index.ts BEFORE loadAgentsFromDatabase() to ensure tools table is populated before agents attempt to load their tool references.

- **✅ Custom Icons Migration**: Moved all custom icons from attached_assets/ (temporary) to kb_storage/media/custom_icons/ (permanent storage) to comply with production persistence requirements.

**Architect Review**: All tasks reviewed and approved for production deployment. Recommendations implemented: comprehensive documentation added, logging enhanced for unmapped tools monitoring.

## System Architecture

### Core System Design
AION operates in a single-tenant mode with a multi-agent architecture and LLM-driven Mixture of Experts (MoE) routing. It includes a 5-level priority chain automatic fallback system and universal multi-language support (PT-BR, EN-US, ES-ES). Specialized agents with dedicated knowledge base namespaces, tool access, and budget limits are supported. A Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) knowledge curation system requires human approval for all content before indexing. A production-ready GPU Pool System manages worker detection, heartbeat monitoring, load balancing, inference priority, and schedule-based rotation. A Continuous Self-Evolution System collects high-quality conversations for instruction tuning and dataset generation, applying HITL. Full Multimodal Processing supports various document types, images, videos, YouTube transcripts, and Deep Web Crawling. The Vision Cascade System provides automatic failover across 5 providers with quota tracking. The agent system includes a level-based hierarchy for agents and sub-agents with cascading deletion. Federated Learning is fully implemented. User & RBAC Management provides enterprise-level user and permission management. The system incorporates a Meta-Learner Service, Adaptive Mixture of Experts (ShiftEx MoE), a Personalized Expert Selection (PM-MoE Aggregator), and a Self-Improvement Engine for autonomous code analysis. Namespace isolation with schema updates ensures cross-tenant protection. GPU orchestration includes 100% official Kaggle API automation, preventive quota thresholds, provider alternation, and continuous quota monitoring. Privacy-preserving heuristics are implemented via adaptive thresholds, LoRA fine-tuning, PII redaction, and a replay buffer. The system uses a demand-based GPU orchestration, dynamically starting/stopping Kaggle GPUs based on workload and tracking usage limits, with smart fallback logic prioritizing internal resources, free APIs, web search, and paid APIs.

### UI/UX
The frontend is built with React 18, Vite, Wouter, and TanStack Query, utilizing Radix UI, shadcn/ui patterns, Tailwind CSS, and a custom HSL-based design system. It features an elegant minimalist design with modern glassmorphism, offering a clean conversational chat interface and an enterprise-level Admin Panel with a consolidated hierarchical menu and full Internationalization (i18n) supporting PT-BR (default), EN-US, ES-ES. All administrative pages are translated, including Dataset, Agent, and Curation Queue management. The Curation Queue for HITL review supports filtering and batch actions. Vision System monitoring displays real-time quota tracking. AI-powered semantic image search and Health Diagnostics are included. The Personality Equalizer offers granular control via 7 functional sliders.

### Technical Implementations
The backend uses Node.js and TypeScript with Express.js and PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM. Key services include LLM Client, Storage, Multi-Agent Router (MoE), namespace-scoped RAG, Agent Engine (ReAct with POMDP), Automatic Fallback, Production-Grade Multimodal Processing, Web Content Discovery, YouTube Transcription Service, Vision Cascade, free LLM Provider rotation, GPU Orchestrator, GPU Pool Manager, GPU Load Balancer, Training Data Collector, Dataset Generator, Auto-Learning System, Token Monitoring, Lifecycle Management, Orphan Detection, Validation (Zod schemas), and a Comprehensive Telemetry System. The Kaggle CLI Service uses environment variables for authentication, lazy loading from SecretsVault, UPM integration, multi-account support, and production-grade error handling. The system includes a Colab Orchestrator Service for Puppeteer automation, a GPU Management UI, a GPU Deletion Service, and an Auto-Scaling Service with a 24/7 Orchestrator. The Namespace Classifier uses LLM-based auto-classification. A Persistent Vector Store is PostgreSQL-backed with LRU cache. Robust error handling and structured logging are implemented. The frontend implements a centralized i18n system and uses Replit Auth (OpenID Connect). RAG combines OpenAI embeddings with BM25. Professional video generation uses an asynchronous job queue. Multi-Cloud Deployment uses Google Cloud Run and AWS Fargate. Training data validation and a Lifecycle Management System are in place. The system implements a production-grade multi-provider billing architecture with real-time cost tracking and automated synchronization.

### System Design Decisions
Key decisions include single-tenant architecture and externalized JSON behavioral configurations for dynamic updates. Comprehensive observability and telemetry include query monitoring, granular hierarchical usage analytics, a modern dashboard with Recharts visualizations, PostgreSQL trigram indexes for optimized search performance, and 29 production-ready REST endpoints for metric access. Security involves AES-256-GCM encryption for API credentials stored in a SecretsVault and injected as environment variables at runtime, supporting multi-account management with individual quota tracking.
